# hello, I hate my class rn

I have to write code that hurts to look at (variables being set a line after being made)
so I thought it'd be cool if I shared what were doing project wise.

## Files and stuff
I upload the project files, and if I have a version I made and a "corrected" version (what the teacher wants) then I upload both.

### pain
as of 8/31/22 we are only doing Visual Basic, but we'll move to Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
as of I think 1/20/23 we are doing Python, bye bye VB! Although we are using replit ._.
