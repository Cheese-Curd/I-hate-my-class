# For context, she said once we were done with the Number Guess thing. We had to make a program to get 2 dice rolls and print them
# This is what I did, literally easiest thing I've ever done

import random
print("You rolled a", random.randint(1, 6), "and a", random.randint(1, 6)) # literally no logic, just calling a function twice then printing it
